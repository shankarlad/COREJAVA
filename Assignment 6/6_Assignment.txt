48.	Create an Abstract class Processor with int member variable data  and method showData to display data value. 
	Create abstract method process() to define processing of member data. Create a class  Factorial using abstract
	class Processor  to calculate and print factorial of a number by overriding the process method. b. Create a class
	Circle using abstract class Processor to calculate and print area of a circle by overriding the process method.
	Ask user to enter choice (factorial or circle area).  Also ask data to work upon. Use Processor class reference to achieve this mechanism.

49.	Create Interface Taxable with members salesTax=7% and incomeTax=10.5%. create abstract method calcTax(). a. Create class
	Employee(empId,name,salary) and implement Taxable to calculate incomeTax on yearly salary. b. Create class Product(pid,price,quantity) 
	and implement Taxable to calculate salesTax on unit price of product. c. Create class for main method(Say XYZ), accept employee information
	and a product information from user and print income tax and sales tax respectively.
