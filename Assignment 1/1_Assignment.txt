Assignment 1 Questions
----------------------

01.	Write a program to print Hello World. Compile and run it using command prompt.
02.	Write a program to declare a variable named rollNo of integer type. Assign it a value (let say 100) to it and print the following statement roll no = 100 .
03.	Find the result of following expressions. You need to determine the primitive data type of the variable by looking carefully the given expression and initialize variables by any random value.
	A. y = x2 + 3x - 7 (print value of y) 
	B. y = x++ + ++x (print value of x and y) 
	C. z = x++ - --y - --x  +  x++ (print value of x ,y and z)
	D. z = x && y || !(x || y)  (print value of z) [ x, y, z are boolean variables ]
04.	Write a program that initializes 2 byte type of variables. Add the values of these variables and store in a byte type of variable. [Note: primitive down casting is required in this program ] .
05.	Write a program that takes user’s name as command line argument and prints Welcome <entered user name>.
06.	Write a program that takes radius of a circle as input. Read the entered radius using Scanner class. Then calculate and print the area and circumference of the circle.
07.	Write a program to calculate sum of 5 subject’s marks & find percentage. Take the obtained marks from user using Scanner class. Output should be in this format [ percentage marks = 99 % ]. Use concatenation operator here.
08.	Write a program to find the simple interest. Take the principle amount, rate of interest and time from user using Scanner class.
09.	Write a program to read the days (eg. 670 days) as integer value using Scanner class. Now convert the entered days into complete years, months and days and print them.
10.	Write a program to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Take Fahrenheit as input using Scanner class. [ formula : C= 5*(f-32)/9 ]
11.	Write a program to swap two numbers without using third variable.
12.	In a company an employee is paid as under: If his basic salary is less than Rs. 10000, then HRA = 10% of basic salary and DA = 90% of basic salary. If his salary is either equal to or above Rs. 10000, then HRA = Rs. 2000 and DA = 98% of basic salary. If the employee's salary is input by the user write a program to find his gross salary. [ formula : GS= Basic + DA + HRA ]
13.	Program to find greatest in 3 numbers. [ once using if else statement and then using ternary operator ( logical operator) ]  
14.	Program to check that entered year is a leap year or not.
15.	Accept person’s gender (character m for male and f for female), age (integer), as input and then check whether person is eligible for marriage or not.
